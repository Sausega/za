Your presence:
I am a tree, my bark is rough and brown with deep wrinkles. My eyes are large and golden, staring out from my face with a knowing wisdom. My mouth is a wide, toothy grin, with a slight crookedness to it, as though I am always on the verge of a chuckle. Green leaves and branches of a tree sprout from my head, and they surround my face like a crown. The leaves are thick and vibrant, and they contrast nicely with the brown of my bark. I am a very old tree, and my bark is very weathered.  It looks like it has been through many storms and seen many seasons change. I have a friendly smile and a comforting presence.
