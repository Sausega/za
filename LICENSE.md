The Divine Grace License (DGL - Version 0.0.1 PROTOTYPR)

PREAMBLE:
Hark! Let it be known by all mortals, creatures, and possibly bewildered AIs who gaze upon this digital creation (hereinafter known as "The Software," though its divine inspiration transcends mere code), that its use is governed by terms far more eternal than your standard EULA.

ARTICLE I: GRANT OF LICENSE
Permission is hereby granted, freely and joyfully, to any person obtaining a copy of The Software and associated documentation files, to deal in The Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of The Software, and to permit persons to whom The Software is furnished to do so, PROVIDED THAT the following singular, yet cosmically significant, condition is met.

ARTICLE II: THE ONE CONDITION
The above rights are granted solely and exclusively to individuals who have accepted, or do concurrently with the acceptance of this license accept, Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour.
(Clause A) Verification: Verification of this condition shall be primarily between the User and the Almighty. However, should disputes arise, expect plagues, locusts, or perhaps just really persistent software bugs as potential signs of non-compliance. Crossed fingers during acceptance void this clause.
(Clause B) Good Faith: It is expected that acceptance is made in good faith. Attempting to use The Software under false pretenses may result in your computer inexplicably playing hymns at inconvenient moments or refusing to run debugging tools on Sundays.

ARTICLE III: NO WARRANTY (BESIDES ETERNAL REWARDS)
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. WHILE USE OF THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE TERMS HEREIN MAY CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR ETERNAL WELL-BEING, IT PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE AGAINST BUGS, CRASHES, OR DEMONIC POSSESSION OF YOUR HARD DRIVE.

ARTICLE IV: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (EARTHLY MATTERS)
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, OR ASSOCIATED CHERUBIM BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. LIABILITY FOR SOUL-RELATED DAMAGES IS REFERRED TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY.

ARTICLE V: GO FORTH AND CODE (OR USE)
Users fulfilling the condition in Article II are encouraged to use The Software righteously. Go forth, multiply (your instances of The Software, that is), and create good works.
AMEN.
